# Diabetes Hospital Readmit Predictions

Hospitals and physicians want to know the likelihood of a diabetic patient being readmitted after receiving treatment. Understanding the odds of readmission helps doctors provide better treatment for patients. All hospitals aim to have low readmission rates since it reflects on the quality of medical care received at the facility and for patients, frequent readmissions indicate a possible instability in their medications or disease management, which is dangerous for a condition like diabetes. The purpose of this project is to analyze anonymous patient hospital visits and create a model that predicts the likelihood of a patient being readmitted given their situation.

The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetes+130-US+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008) and represents a selection of 10 years worth of hospital visits by anonymous diabetic patients. Vital information including the patientâ€™s demographics and medications is included, as well as any diagnoses received and medication prescribed during the visit.
